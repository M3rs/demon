## Short Term
- Correct player to move as before (probably needs lots of cleanup)
- Player transform polish -- add sounds, change oneshot w/ parameter to starting a mixer snapshot when transformed
- perform draw calls in proper order (right now map is not really ordered)

## BUGS
- TBD (they're there, let's not kid ourselves)

## Collision / Jumping
- re-implement
- Clean up

## Other "game object" / "mobs"
- Publicly accessable: ways to check for collision with another Rect (possibly via sprite)
- unique identifer?

## basic terrain
- different-ish from mob, but not really?

## Animations
- Add basic animation(s)
- Should probably have a texture and a set of IntRects for frames?
